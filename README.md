# Secured – Hash Table Implementation in C

## Description

Secured is a custom implementation of a hash table written in C.  
This project focuses on designing and implementing a dynamic key-value store using a hash function, handling collisions, and ensuring efficient data access.

## Project Goals

- Implement a hash table in C
- Develop and test a custom hash function
- Handle collision using chaining
- Manage dynamic memory allocation
- Understand performance implications

## Technologies Used

- Language: C
- Data structures (hash table, linked lists)
- Memory management (`malloc`, `free`)
- Modular code structure
- Makefile

## Implemented Features

- Insert, search and delete operations
- Custom hash function
- Collision resolution (e.g., chaining or linear probing)
- Error checking and handling
- Basic tests for functionality

## Compilation

library make
